&emsp;&emsp;   The accessibility to spatiotemporal analytical tools is currently limited for public health workers and researchers, a user interface using RShiny will also be developed to increase accessibility and facilitate visualization and analysis for future spatiotemporal epidemiological studies. In addition, RShiny is effectively compatible with R-INLA which is the package we used to perform the analysis. To better communicate the results to stakeholders and public health researchers, we will develop user interfaces in the form of web applications with interactive features. However, the spatiotemporal analysis methods have limited availability, particularly for non-technical
users. Moreover, the previously developed user interfaces do not provide specific features, such as proper cluster detection and space-time association with risk factors. We will then investigate and integrate these features into our project. Therefore, a web application using RShiny will be developed to increase accessibility and facilitate visualization and analysis for future spatiotemporal epidemiological studies. In addition, though this interface will be built in the context of mental health as a case study, this web application can be applied to the space-time analysis of other diseases.

&emsp;&emsp; **STEHealth** (It stands for **S**patiotemporal **E**pidemiological **Health**) is a application for analyzing space-time pattern, cluster detection, and association with risk factors of health outcomes, which allows users to import their own data, analyze, and visualize.
This application is part of "Spatiotemporal Analysis with Application Development for Epidemiological Study of Suicide Mortality" project of the [King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi](https://www.kmutt.ac.th/en/).
