# STEHealth-Application üåèüíª

**STEHealth** (It stands for **S**patiotemporal **E**pidemiological **Health**) is a shiny application for analyzing space-time pattern, **cluster detection**, and **association with risk factors** of health outcomes, which allows users to import their own data, analyze, and visualize.

This application is part of **```Spatiotemporal analysis with application development for epidemiological study of suicide mortality: From global perspectives to a case study in Thailand üíÄüìù```** senior project of the Princess Srisavangavadhana College of Medicine, [Chulabhorn Royal Academy](https://www.cra.ac.th/th/home) and the Department of Computer Engineering, [King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi](https://www.kmutt.ac.th/en/).

## Installation üíª
There are two installation methods.

**The first method:** Clone this repository 

Clone this repository and install R and R packages. Some R packages, such as [r-inla](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install) and [capture](https://github.com/dreamRs/capture), need to be manually installed by the user as they are not available on CRAN.
 

**The second method:** Portable Application (supported Windows OS only)

The STEHealth Portable Application eliminates the need for users to individually install R and its packages, as these components come pre-installed. 

1. Go to this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gKW8w891qTPaKvu2-IGe38mEXaXtG39W?usp=share_link) to download the portable application.
2. Extract the downloaded file.
3. To launch the portable application, simply execute the ```\STEHealth_Portable\dist\run.vbs``` file without the necessity to view or modify any underlying code. (Note that: If you open "run.vbs" and the application doesn't open or the web application is blank, please press "run.vbs" several times.) 
4. Now you can use the application.




## Sample Data üìÅ
The sample data used for case study in this application consists of Thailand shapefile and csv file (Thai suicide mortality and risk factors 2011-2021)



* **Thailand shapefile** contains 4 files that cannot be missing any of them due to their references to each other: shp, dbf, shx, and prj. These Shapefiles represent **provincial boundaries (Level 1)**.

Thailand shapefile
</p> 



* **csv file (Thailand suicide mortality and risk factors 2011-2021)** contains the following 12 columns: 

    **1. province** is the name of province which has a total of 77 provinces.

    **2. province_id** is the number of province starting at from 1 to 77 .

    **3. year** is the number of year starting at from 1 to 11.

    **4. suicide** is the number of suicides.

    **5.Population** population in each area.

    **6-12. 7 covariates:** debt, income, poverty, expenditure, homicide crime, property crime and shocking crime.

### ü©πLimitations
- Application can support only English.
- Application works effectively on desktops only. We recommend using a screen size of at least 1440x900 pixels for the best viewing experience.
- The operation of the application relies on the system resources of the device it is running on.
- Installation packages must require because an application can not publish to shiny server on the [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) website. However, we encountered a problem because shinyapps.io only supports packages that are located in CRAN, which is R‚Äôs central software repository supported by the R Foundation [[2]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html). Unfortunately, the ```R-INLA package``` is not included in CRAN, which prevented us from deploying the app to the cloud.
