# STEHealth-Application 🌏💻

**STEHealth** (It stands for **S**patiotemporal **E**pidemiological **Health**) is a shiny application for analyzing space-time pattern, **cluster detection**, and **association with risk factors** of health outcomes, which allows users to import their own data, analyze, and visualize.

This application is part of "Spatiotemporal Analysis with Application Development for Epidemiological Study of Suicide Mortality" senior project of the [King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi](https://www.kmutt.ac.th/en/).
