# STEHealth-Application üåèüíª

**STEHealth** (It stands for **S**patiotemporal **E**pidemiological **Health**) is a shiny application for analyzing space-time pattern, **cluster detection**, and **association with risk factors** of health outcomes, which allows users to import their own data, analyze, and visualize.

This application is part of **```Spatiotemporal analysis with application development for epidemiological study of suicide mortality: From global perspectives to a case study in Thailand üíÄüìù```** senior project of the Princess Srisavangavadhana College of Medicine, [Chulabhorn Royal Academy](https://www.cra.ac.th/th/home) and the Department of Computer Engineering, [King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi](https://www.kmutt.ac.th/en/).

## Installation üíª
There are three installation methods.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ The first method:** STEHealthApp package 

This method is suitable for **users who already have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/)** and prefer not to load the .zip file, especially those who have been using RStudio for a while.

1. Install **STEHealthApp package** by running the following line of code in RStudio:
```
devtools::install_github("mill-ornrakorn/STEHealth-Application", ref="STEHealthApp")
```

2. Install **[R-INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/home) and [capture](https://github.com/dreamRs/capture) packages** by running the following line of code in RStudio:
```
install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)
```
```
remotes::install_github("dreamRs/capture")
```

3. After the packages have been installed, type the following in RStudio, and the application window will appear.
```
library(STEHealthApp)
run_app()
```


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ The second method:** .R file Application 

This method is suitable for **users who already have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/)** and may use RStudio for some time.

1. Clone this repository or download this repository in [releases page](https://github.com/mill-ornrakorn/STEHealth-Application/releases) or this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HDIO4duSiyy8OZblIBx4-6V3PdM6kfom?usp=sharing) to download the .zip file. 

2. Extract the downloaded file.

3. Open ```runShinyApp.R``` via RStudio

4. Press ```Run App``` and wait for a moment. The program will automatically install the libraries required* by the application. (*For a list of libraries, please refer to [tools section](https://github.com/mill-ornrakorn/STEHealth-Application/tree/optional-expected-value#tools-).)


5. Now you can use the application.

<!--
Clone this repository or download this repository in [releases](https://github.com/mill-ornrakorn/STEHealth-Application/releases) and install R and R packages. Some R packages, such as [r-inla](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install) and [capture](https://github.com/dreamRs/capture), need to be manually installed by the user as they are not available on CRAN.
-->

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ The third method:** Portable Application (supported Windows OS only)

This method is suitable for **`users who do not have R and RStudio at all`** because in this method we have already installed them all (including R packages) in portable application.

<!-- The STEHealth Portable Application eliminates the need for users to individually install R and its packages, as these components come pre-installed. 
-->

1. Go to this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gKW8w891qTPaKvu2-IGe38mEXaXtG39W?usp=share_link) to download the portable application.

2. Extract the downloaded file.

3. To launch the portable application, simply execute the ```\STEHealth_Portable\dist\run.vbs``` file without the necessity to view or modify any underlying code. (Note that: If you open ```run.vbs``` and the application doesn't open or the web application is blank, please press ```run.vbs``` several times.) 

4. Now you can use the application.




## Sample Data üìÅ
The [sample data](https://github.com/mill-ornrakorn/STEHealth-Application/tree/main/sample%20data) used for case study in this application consists of Thailand shapefile and csv file (Suicide Mortality and Risk Factors in Thailand from 2011 to 2021)



* **Thailand shapefile** contains 4 files that cannot be missing any of them due to their references to each other: shp, dbf, shx, and prj. These Shapefiles represent **provincial boundaries (Level 1)**.

</br>
Thailand shapefile
</p> 



* **csv file (Suicide Mortality and Risk Factors in Thailand from 2011 to 2021)** contains the following 12 columns: 

    **1. province** refers to the administrative divisions in Thailand, of which there are a total of 77 provinces.

    **2. province_id** is the number of province starting at from 1 to 77 .

    **3. year** is the number of year from 2011 to 2021.

    **4. suicide** is the number of suicides.

    **5.Population** population in each area.

    **6-12. 7 covariates:** debt, income, poverty, expenditure, homicide crime, property crime and shocking crime.

### ü©πLimitations
- Application can support only English.
- Application works effectively on desktops only. We recommend using a screen size of at least 1440x900 pixels for the best viewing experience.
- The operation of the application relies on the system resources of the device it is running on.
- Installation packages must require because an application can not publish to shiny server on the [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) website. However, we encountered a problem because shinyapps.io only supports packages that are located in CRAN, which is R‚Äôs central software repository supported by the R Foundation [[2]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html). Unfortunately, the ```R-INLA package``` is not included in CRAN, which prevented us from deploying the app to the cloud. We explored alternative deployment options, such as deploying the app on Amazon Web Services (AWS) [[3](https://www.charlesbordet.com/en/guide-shiny-aws/) ,[4](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-host-a-r-shiny-app-on-aws-cloud-in-7-simple-steps-5595e7885722)] and deploying the app on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Docker [[5](https://anderfernandez.com/en/blog/put-shiny-app-into-production/) ,[6](https://towardsdatascience.com/dockerizing-and-deploying-a-shiny-dashboard-on-google-cloud-a990ceb3c33a)]. However, we encountered issues with some other packages. As a result, we made the decision to create a **portable application** instead.
