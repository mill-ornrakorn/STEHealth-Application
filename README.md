# STEHealth-Application 🌏💻

**STEHealth** (It stands for **S**patiotemporal **E**pidemiological **Health**) is a shiny application for analyzing space-time pattern, **cluster detection**, and **association with risk factors** of health outcomes, which allows users to import their own data, analyze, and visualize.

This application is part of ```Spatiotemporal Analysis with Application Development for Epidemiological Study of Suicide Mortality 💀📝``` senior project of the [King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi](https://www.kmutt.ac.th/en/). 

### 💡Feature
1. Analysis for spatial and spatiotemporal epidemiological studies and ```cluster detection``` and ```association with risk factors```.

2. ```Upload data``` for analysis into the application for analysis.

3. ```Download results``` of analysis from the application.

### 🩹Limitations
- Application can support only English.
- Application works effectively on desktops only.
- Installation packages must require because an application can not publish to shiny server on the [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) website. However, we encountered a problem because shinyapps.io only supports packages that are located in CRAN, which is R’s central software repository supported by the R Foundation [2]. Unfortunately, the ```R-INLA package``` is not included in CRAN, which prevented us from deploying the app to the cloud.
