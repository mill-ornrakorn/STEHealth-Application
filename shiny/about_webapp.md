<!-- style = " margin-bottom: 20px;"> -->

###  **Purpose**
<img width="40px" height="10px" src="Rectangle.svg">

&emsp;&emsp; The primary goal of this software is to bridge the gap between advanced statistical modeling and practical public health applications. By providing an intuitive interface, we aim to make cutting-edge methodologies like Bayesian hierarchical modeling accessible to users without extensive computational expertise.


###  **Features**
<img width="40px" height="10px" src="Rectangle.svg">

- **Interactive Mapping:** Visualize spatial data using customizable maps, enabling insights into health trends and patterns.
- **Cluster Detection:** Identify hotspots and non-hotspots within your data using advanced spatial models.
- **Risk Factor Analysis:** Explore associations between risk factors and health outcomes across geographic areas.
- **User-Friendly Filters:** Customize visualizations with time points, risk factors, and color schemes to suit your analysis needs.
- **Data Integration:** Seamlessly upload shapefiles and case data for dynamic analysis.



###  **Development Approach**
<img width="40px" height="10px" src="Rectangle.svg">

This software was developed using an iterative design process, incorporating feedback from public health professionals and data scientists. Built on the robust RShiny framework, the application combines technical precision with an emphasis on usability. Extensive usability testing and user interviews guided the development to ensure the interface meets the diverse needs of its users.



###  **Target Users**
